Road-Accident-Dashboard

Hello Everyone,
I have created a Road Accident Dashboard using 2021-22 data. This data helps clients to create such a wonderful dashboard so that they can have insight on the below requirements.

• Primary KPI – Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth.

• Primary KPIs – Total Casualties by Accident severity for Current Year and YoY growth.

• Secondary KPIs – Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year.

• Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year.

• Casualties by Road Type for Current Year.

• Current Year Casualties by Area / Location and by Day / Night.

• Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.

• Stakeholders – Ministry of Transport, Road Transport Department, Police Force, Emergency Services Department, Road Safety Corps, Transport Operators, Traffic Management Agencies, 
                 Public and Media.
